        #This game was done when I was in school but now I implemented AI
        before it used to be a game for two  real players

        # This code is done by student of Riga Technical University (RTU)
        # Name,Surname: Maksims Bokijs; ID Number:211RDB167

        #   In this project was done a game ,which is known everyone as CHECKERS
        ,it was written using (pygame) and using minimax algorithm ,in this
        game participate two players :
        #1. real person
        #2.AI witch uses MinMAx algorithm

        #GUI:✅
        #RESTART OF THE GAME AFTER END OF PREVIOUS:✅
        #CHOOSE WHO START FIRST (AI or real person):✅/❌

        FEATURE 🔜:
        #1 In future would like to implement  self-learning AI,wich will
        collect data to Data Base and learns every wrong game move from previous game.

        #2 Make more user friendly GUI with more options
